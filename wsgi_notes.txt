This is what I added to Apache's configs:

<VirtualHost smoker:80>
   ServerName smoker
   ServerAlias smoker
   ServerAdmin webmaster@smoker

   DocumentRoot /tmp/public_html

   WSGIScriptAlias /cards /home/jason/projects/mtgdbpy/mtgdb.wsgi/cards

   <Directory /home/jason/projects/mtgdbpy>
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

   Alias /cn /home/jason/projects/mtgdbpy/cn
   Alias /static /home/jason/projects/mtgdbpy/cstatic

</VirtualHost>
