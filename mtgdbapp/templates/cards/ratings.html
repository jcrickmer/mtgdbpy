      Note that <em>lower</em> Quality of Score means that the ranking is more accurate.

    <p>
      This table is a list of cards that have been rated in the current Standard format. The cards that were choosen for rating were weighted so that the top ~110 cards being played in decks were presented about 50% of the time, and all cards in standard were presented about 50% of the time. Thus, cards that are not seeing much play in tournament-level play are (a) not this list, or (b) liekly to have a worse Quality of Score (a higher number).
