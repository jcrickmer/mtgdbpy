Adding cards is still tricky and laborious

Step 1:
Get the latest card set json from mtgjson.com.

Step 2a:
Load those cards into the database with the loadcardjson Django command.

./manage.py loadcardjson DDO-x.json

Step 2b:

Get all of the new card images. From the mtgstats directory...

echo 'SELECT DISTINCT multiverseid FROM card WHERE expansionset_id = 189 ORDER BY multiverseid;' | mysql -u root -ppassword mtgdbpy | ./fetch_images.pl

And set the expansionset_id to be the id for the new expansion set.

Step 3:
Create new formats. You will need to know the start and end dates for the new formats. Here are some examples.

INSERT INTO format (formatname, format, start_date, end_date, max_cards_main, max_cards_side, max_nonbl_card_count, min_cards_main, min_cards_side, uses_command_zone,abbr) VALUES ('Commander','Commander_2019-01-25','2019-01-25','2019-04-26',100,0,1,100,0,1,'EDH');
INSERT INTO format (formatname, format, start_date, end_date, max_cards_main, max_cards_side, max_nonbl_card_count, min_cards_main, min_cards_side, uses_command_zone,abbr) VALUES ('Modern','Modern_2019-01-25','2019-01-25','2019-04-26',1000,15,4,60,0,0,'MOD');
INSERT INTO format (formatname, format, start_date, end_date, max_cards_main, max_cards_side, max_nonbl_card_count, min_cards_main, min_cards_side, uses_command_zone,abbr) VALUES ('Standard','Standard_2019-01-25','2019-01-25','2019-04-26',1000,15,4,60,0,0,'STD');
INSERT INTO format (formatname, format, start_date, end_date, max_cards_main, max_cards_side, max_nonbl_card_count, min_cards_main, min_cards_side, uses_command_zone,abbr) VALUES ('Legacy','Legacy_2019-01-25','2019-01-25','2019-04-26',1000,15,4,60,0,0,'LEG');
INSERT INTO format (formatname, format, start_date, end_date, max_cards_main, max_cards_side, max_nonbl_card_count, min_cards_main, min_cards_side, uses_command_zone,abbr) VALUES ('TinyLeaders','Tiny Leaders_2016-04-08','2016-04-08','2016-07-21',50,15,1,50,0,1,'TL');
INSERT INTO format (formatname, format, start_date, end_date, max_cards_main, max_cards_side, max_nonbl_card_count, min_cards_main, min_cards_side, uses_command_zone,abbr) VALUES ('ShadowsOverInnistrad','BlockLimited_SOI_2016-04-02','2016-04-02','2016-07-15',1000,15,4,60,0,0,'SOI');

Step 4:
With the cards loaded, and with formats created, you now need to populate the new cards into the new formats. For the eternal formats, it is easy enough to just copy all of the existing formatbasecard entries for the previous format into a temp table, add the new cards, and then push them back into the formatbasecard table

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE foo AS (SELECT basecard_id AS basecard_id, 18 AS format_id FROM formatbasecard WHERE format_id = 15);
INSERT INTO foo (SELECT basecard_id, 18 as format_id FROM card WHERE expansionset_id = 184);

INSERT INTO foo (SELECT basecard_id AS basecard_id, 19 AS format_id FROM formatbasecard WHERE format_id = 17);
INSERT INTO foo (SELECT basecard_id, 19 as format_id FROM card WHERE expansionset_id = 184);

INSERT IGNORE INTO formatbasecard (basecard_id, format_id) SELECT basecard_id, format_id FROM foo;
DROP TABLE foo;

For TinyLeaders, you will need to be more selective and just do CMC < 3.

INSERT INTO foo (SELECT basecard_id, 40 as format_id FROM card JOIN basecard AS bc ON bc.id = card.basecard_id WHERE expansionset_id > 189 AND bc.cmc < 4);

Also, you will need to figure out the ban list updates and remove those, as necessary.

For standard rotations, it is probably best to just start over and load all 4 previous expansions in individually, then the new expansion set.

Step 5:
Now bring over all of the battles.

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE fooy AS (SELECT battle_date, 107 AS format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id FROM battle WHERE format_id = 99);
INSERT INTO fooy (SELECT battle_date, 108 AS format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id FROM battle WHERE format_id = 100);
INSERT INTO fooy (SELECT battle_date, 109 AS format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id FROM battle WHERE format_id = 102);
INSERT INTO fooy (SELECT battle_date, 110 AS format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id FROM battle WHERE format_id = 101);

INSERT INTO fooy (SELECT battle_date, 42 AS format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id FROM battle JOIN basecard AS wbc ON winner_pcard_id = wbc.physicalcard_id JOIN basecard AS lbc ON loser_pcard_id = lbc.physicalcard_id WHERE format_id = 37 AND wbc.id IN (SELECT basecard_id FROM formatbasecard WHERE format_id = 42) AND lbc.id IN (SELECT basecard_id FROM formatbasecard WHERE format_id = 42));

And then push them into battle again.

INSERT IGNORE INTO battle (battle_date, format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id) SELECT battle_date, format_id, loser_pcard_id, session_key, winner_pcard_id FROM fooy;
DROP TABLE fooy;

Again, you will probably need to do something a little bit different for Standard set rotations and possibly for bannings.

** Special fun for bringing over all cards to a new format, like Pauper. **
SELECT battle_date, 48 AS format_id, loser_pcard_id, NULL, winner_pcard_id, test_id FROM battle WHERE format_id = 40 AND loser_pcard_id IN (SELECT physicalcard_id FROM basecard bc JOIN formatbasecard fbc ON bc.id = fbc.basecard_id WHERE format_id = 48) AND winner_pcard_id IN (SELECT physicalcard_id FROM basecard bc JOIN formatbasecard fbc ON bc.id = fbc.basecard_id WHERE format_id = 48);


Step 6:
Update all of the card ratings based on the new formats and recently copied-over battles into the new formats:

./manage.py updatecardratings

Step 7:
Need to update all of the Similiar Physical Cards.

Step 7a:
Generate all of the search docs.

rm /tmp/cards_for_lucene/*
./manage.py gencarddocsforlucene --outdir /tmp/cards_for_lucene

Step 7b:
Now move over to the Lucene 4.6.1 instance that we are using on smoker (the dev box), and for good measure, recompile the Java classes we are using:

cd ../clustering/lucene-4.6.1
javac -cp core/lucene-core-4.6.1.jar:queryparser/lucene-queryparser-4.6.1.jar:analysis/common/lucene-analyzers-common-4.6.1.jar:demo/lucene-demo-4.6.1.jar:. MTG*.java

Step 7c:
Index all of the documents:

java -cp core/lucene-core-4.6.1.jar:queryparser/lucene-queryparser-4.6.1.jar:analysis/common/lucene-analyzers-common-4.6.1.jar:demo/lucene-demo-4.6.1.jar:. MTGIndexer -docs /tmp/cards_for_lucene/

Step 7d:
Run the search algo on the documents. NOTE that the MTGSearch class is currently just looking at the first 25000 phsyicalcard.ids. This needs to be improved in the future.

java -cp core/lucene-core-4.6.1.jar:queryparser/lucene-queryparser-4.6.1.jar:analysis/common/lucene-analyzers-common-4.6.1.jar:demo/lucene-demo-4.6.1.jar:. MTGSearch > sims.sql

Step 7e:
Delete all of the current similarphysicalcard entries and stick our new entries in there:

mysql -u root -p -e 'DELETE FROM similarphysicalcard;' mtgdbpy
mysql -u root -p mtgdbpy < sims.sql

Step 8:
Back in the main mtgdb directory, update the Solr index so that tutoring works correctly.

./manage rebuild_index

Note that since this is not stored in the MySQL database, if the data updates are being staged on a dev box and then being mysqldumped to be moved back to production, this command will need to be run in dev and production.


Appendix:

Are there cards in Tinyleaders that shouldn't be there? You can see with:

SELECT bc.id, bc.name, bc.cmc FROM formatbasecard As fbc JOIN basecard AS bc on bc.id = fbc.basecard_id WHERE format_id IN (17, 19) AND bc.cmc > 3;

and then you can remove them:

DELETE FROM formatbasecard WHERE format_id IN (SELECT id FROM format WHERE formatname = 'TinyLeaders') AND basecard_id IN (SELECT bc.id FROM basecard AS fc JOIN basecard AS bc ON bc.physicalcard_id = fc.physicalcard_id AND fc.cardposition IN ('F','L','U') AND bc.cardposition NOT IN ('F','L','U') WHERE fc.cmc > 3 OR bc.cmc > 3);
DELETE FROM formatbasecard WHERE format_id IN (SELECT id FROM format WHERE formatname = 'TinyLeaders') AND basecard_id IN (SELECT fc.id FROM basecard AS fc JOIN basecard AS bc ON bc.physicalcard_id = fc.physicalcard_id AND fc.cardposition IN ('F','L','U') AND bc.cardposition NOT IN ('F','L','U') WHERE fc.cmc > 3 OR bc.cmc > 3);
DELETE FROM cardrating WHERE format_id IN (SELECT id FROM format WHERE formatname = 'TinyLeaders') AND physicalcard_id IN (SELECT fc.physicalcard_id FROM basecard AS fc JOIN basecard AS bc ON bc.physicalcard_id = fc.physicalcard_id AND fc.cardposition IN ('F','L','U') AND bc.cardposition NOT IN ('F','L','U') WHERE fc.cmc > 3 OR bc.cmc > 3);
DELETE FROM battle WHERE format_id IN (SELECT id FROM format WHERE formatname = 'TinyLeaders') AND loser_pcard_id IN (SELECT fc.physicalcard_id FROM basecard AS fc JOIN basecard AS bc ON bc.physicalcard_id = fc.physicalcard_id AND fc.cardposition IN ('F','L','U') AND bc.cardposition NOT IN ('F','L','U') WHERE fc.cmc > 3 OR bc.cmc > 3);
DELETE FROM battle WHERE format_id IN (SELECT id FROM format WHERE formatname = 'TinyLeaders') AND winner_pcard_id IN (SELECT fc.physicalcard_id FROM basecard AS fc JOIN basecard AS bc ON bc.physicalcard_id = fc.physicalcard_id AND fc.cardposition IN ('F','L','U') AND bc.cardposition NOT IN ('F','L','U') WHERE fc.cmc > 3 OR bc.cmc > 3);
